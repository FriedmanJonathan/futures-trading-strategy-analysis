# futures-trading-strategy-analysis
Algorithm for the parametric calculation of futures trading strategy profitability (complete) and data analysis on the results (in progress). 

This project showcases some advanced algorthmic work in which robustness is absolutely necessary to ensure that the trading strategy is executed precisely as specified, preemptively taking into account a large number of edge cases. The program is CPU parallelized using Pandarallel; GPU parallelization should be relatively straightforward (but as my laptop's GPU isn't CUDA compatible...). Raw data is propietary and not provided.
