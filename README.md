Using raw futures trading data (bids/asks/trades, data not included), runs an algorithm which can parametrically calculate (in parallel) the profitability of hundreds of thousands of trading strategies, and then an analysis is conducted on the results.

This project showcases some advanced algorthmic work in which robustness is absolutely necessary to ensure that the trades are executed precisely as specified.
