# futures-trading-strategy-analysis

A project of two parts: 
**futures_main.py** - takes raw futures trading data (bids/asks/trades) and runs an algorithm which can parametrically calculate (in parallel) the profitability of hundreds of thousands of trading strategies. This project showcases some advanced algorthmic work in which robustness is absolutely necessary to ensure that the trades are executed precisely as specified.
**Strategy Analysis.ipynb** - a Jupyter Notebook analyzing the result of the dataframe generated by Part I of the project.
